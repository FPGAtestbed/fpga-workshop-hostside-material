title: Setup

## Outline

- Introduction to accelerators, FPGAs & OpenCL
- Buffers, memory management and data transfer
- Kernel loading, launching and synchronisation

## The example

In this section we'll be working on the `saxpy_example` from the [UCL/FPGA_Intro_Workshop repository](https://github.com/UCL/FPGA_Intro_Workshop).

## Useful resources

- [The host_support library](https://github.com/FPGAtestbed/host_support)
- [OpenCL C++ Bindings](https://github.khronos.org/OpenCL-CLHPP/)
  - This documentation is a little hard to read and sometimes incomplete. It may be that reading the source code of the library is easier.
- [OpenCL 2.1 Reference Pages](https://man.opencl.org/)
  - Only documents the C API but can be more informative than the C++ Bindings documentation
- [The best list of OpenCL error codes I can find](https://streamhpc.com/blog/2013-04-28/opencl-error-codes/)
- [Vitisâ„¢Hardware Acceleration Introduction Tutorial](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/tree/2022.1/Hardware_Acceleration/Introduction)
